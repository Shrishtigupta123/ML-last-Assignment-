## Cryptocurrency Liquidity Prediction for Market Stability
Project Overview
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the liquidity of various cryptocurrencies with the goal of enhancing market stability. Liquidity, a critical factor in financial markets, indicates how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. In the volatile and decentralized world of cryptocurrency, understanding and forecasting liquidity can help investors, exchanges, and regulators manage risk and improve decision-making.

üéØ Objectives
Develop a machine learning model to predict cryptocurrency liquidity using historical market data.

Analyze market patterns that impact liquidity across different coins.

Provide early indicators of potential illiquidity or instability in the crypto market.

Support market participants with actionable insights to ensure smoother trading experiences.

üìä Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering from real-world crypto exchange APIs or datasets.

Visualization of liquidity trends over time.

Predictive modeling using regression techniques (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM).

Evaluation of model performance with standard metrics (RMSE, MAE, R¬≤).

Insights dashboard (optional) to interpret predictions interactively.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

FastAPI (optional, used to build a RESTful API or interactive dashboard)
